## Setup
**Install:**
`> npm i`

**Run:**
`> npm start`

## Key Bindings
**Game controls**
 * spacebar: pause
 * V: add 1 ball
 * B: increase/decrease paddle size and speed

**Player 1:**
 * a: up
 * z: down

**Player 2:**
 * ▲ : up
 * ▼: down

##Gameplay
Control the paddles up and down to deflect the balls away from your sideline with the objective to score on the opponent's side. An energy ball can be summoned by triggering the V key (Hadouken!) and the paddle size can be manipulated to vamp up the diffculty!

##Technology 
 * HTML
 * CSS3
 * Git/Github
 * Javascript
 * Webpack/Babel
 * ES2015

##Personal Learning
This project introduced me to Webpack, Babel, and ES2015 which I had no knowledge of before. Previously working with Gulp, Webpack is similar in functionality while utilizing less lines of codes which I found impressive and efficient. Writing with ES2015 reminded me of some similarities to the Java language which I have a little bit of familiarity with. With that being said, this project really challenged me to think back to my Java roots and also pushed me to think deeply about how to solve problems regarding what I wanted my Pong game to do. All in all, I gained a better understanding of Javascript while still acknowledging that I am only just breaking the surface and I am excited to learn more!

##TODO
 * Fix error/figure proper solution to instantiating empty/new ball
 * Implement winner system
 * Add energy ball upon trigger from paddles
